## Performance benchmark

> Notes: 
> 1. At the first time you build the Docs repository on your local machine, we need to restore all the dependencies(Template repository and CRR repositories, build dependencies), it will take some time, which depends on your network.
> 2. We will cache all the restored resource.
> 3. We only run restore on VS Code re-open.
